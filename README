muttjump
written by Johannes Wei√ül

This script makes mail indexers (like mairix, mu, nmzmail, or notmuch)
together with mutt more useful.

These search engines usually create a virtual maildir containing symbolic
links to the original mails, which can be browsed using mutt.
It would be optimal if mutt somehow knew that the two maildir entries
identify the same mail, but this is not that easy (mail folder
abstraction from different formats, no tight integration of mail indexers).

So if one wants to rename (for setting/clearing flags), delete or edit the
mails, it is only possible using the original mail. This (very simple)
script helps to jump to this message, using e.g. this macro in .muttrc:

macro generic ,j "<enter-command>push <pipe-message>muttjump<enter><enter>" "jump to original message"

Don't forget to quit the new mutt instance (started by muttjump) after
the modifications. To make jumping faster (no keypress required), unset
$wait_key in your ~/.muttrc.

The way described above will open a new instance of mutt. Another option is 
to invoke this script as muttjump-same. In that case, a file ~/.muttjump 
will be created. This file will contain instructions for mutt, which will, 
after sourcing, lead to the jump to the desired message (and deletion of
~/.muttjump). For that purpose, following macro might be used:

macro generic ,j "<pipe-message>muttjump-same<enter>:source ~/.muttjump<enter>" "jump to original message"

Note: the latter usage of the script requires a symlink called
muttjump-same with this script as a target to be created.
